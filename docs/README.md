# Hunter's NixOS Configuration
This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration(s) and is not necessarily intended for personal use, though I am keeping it public in the hopes it may one day prove useful for someone out there working on their own configuration. It's nowhere near where I want it to be yet, but we're getting there.

*This repository is a work in progress.*

## What I'd Like to Accomplish with this Project
- Create a stable, reproducible configuration that sets up my computer exactly the way I like it
- Keep my configuration consistent on all of my devices: my desktop PC, laptop, and (eventually, once I figure out how) my cell phone.
- Document everything. The Readme should (eventually) contain a clear, consise explanation of how it all fits together, my thought processes and reasoning behind the way I've structured things, and recommendations for how I think a new NixOS user should go about building their own system(s). I want this project to be a useful reference for anyone looking to enter the world of Nix.
- Push myself to learn new things. I want to be more efficient and effective in what I do, so I've been dabbling in new tools like Vim and Bash scripting to help me go about my day-to-day life. In the near future I plan on breaking into a few new ones that I think will be useful (listed below).

## "Short-term"  Goals
- Set up Emacs with Evil Mode, Magit, and Org-Mode
- Switch from KDE Plasma to Hyprland
- Personalize my workspaces, window rules, and keybinds so that window management & navigation is as smooth and easy as possible
- Build my own desktop environment with Quickshell
- Expand on the documentation for my configuration so it becomes a useful example
- Modularize my configuration so I can use it for my desktop, laptop, and (eventually) a small NAS box running on a Raspberry Pi. Build it in a way that I can reuse certain modules on multiple devices while retaining the ability to customize certain aspects when needed
- Automate certain mundane tasks like garbage collection, updating from upstream sources, file backups, etc.
